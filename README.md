# My Front-End Web Development Journey

I welcome everyone who is right now on my GitHub. I hope you all are in a very happy mood. If youâ€™re not then please smile.

Here, I share with you all my personal journey of how Iâ€™m learning Web development, specifically Front-end Web development. The things I did, my methodology, what are some of the challenges Iâ€™m facing during my learning journey and how I am now able to make Websites that people appreciate, what more I need ( because you know learning never stops ). I will update here as I progress to learn more and more things. So once again SMILE ðŸ˜„.

 

# 1. Starting with HTML

First in my Development journey I encountered HTML (Hyper Text Markup Language). To learn this I first learned its basic building concepts and then dived into the advanced HTML where I did practice on forms and other advanced stuff of HTML. I also made some Webpages using HTML and with the help of it my command on HTML got better. 

I recommend any one of you who are currently learning HTML to make a few webpages to get a better grip on this Markup Language.

 

# 2. Next was CSS

After learning HTML next I got my hands on CSS (Cascading Style Sheets). I started off with Inline, Internal and External CSS. Then I went on to learn about Classes and IDâ€™s. Intermediate CSS concepts such as The box model, Display properties and the Positioning elements were somewhat tricky, and fun at the same time. Ended CSS with float and clear.

Those currently learning CSS, I will advice them to build a basic personal webpage or website so that they can sharpen their concepts.

### After having learned HTML and CSS, I made two personal portfolio webpage. First using only HTML and some small CSS concepts. In second webpage I used intermediate CSS and other intermediate properties of Cascading Style Sheets.

# 3. Learning Bootstrap

Learning CSS gave me an edge to start off with Bootstrap, one of the most used CSS framework. Navigation bar was the first thing I tried to master in this framework. Grid layout and Containers are the only things that you have to give more focus when learning Bootstrap. Buttons and fonts are relatively easy.

After all learning Bootstrap is quite easy than CSS as it has most of the codes already available but you should focus on using vanilla CSS and learning its advanced features like flexbox and others.

### After mastering Bootstrap I made a website which is same as Tinder but instead of humans its tinder for Dogs.

# 4. Logic with JavaScript

JavaScript or famously called the Brain of a website was the first big thing that I had to learn.

Similar to other programming languages it also starts with data types, variables and other basic stuffs. After learning these concepts I learned some of the JavaScript functions such as slicing and case changing. Then I went on to learn some of the intermediate concepts such as functions, control statements, arrays and comparators.

The DOM (Document Object Model) was also the thing that I learned as I was learning JavaScript.

Manipulating HTML elements using JavaScript, HTML attributes, text manipulation and text content property were some of the things.

For me JavaScript was not that complex to learn because I had learned two other programming languages before jumping off on JavaScript. If your first language is JavaScript I will advice you to not go fast but clear the concepts first.

### Using the logic with JavaScript and DOM I was able to make 2 sites. The first one is a dice game website. The second is a drum roll site.

# 5. React js.

Currently I am learning a famous JavaScript framework which is React.
